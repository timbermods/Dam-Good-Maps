# Water, soil moisture, contamination & weather rules (Timberborn 1.1.2.4)

Research notes for the Dam Good Maps generator and validator.

**Sources.** Decompiled assemblies in `investigation/decompiled/`. Blueprints in `investigation/raw/blueprints/`. 19 official 1.1 maps, 9 workshop maps and 2 saves (1.1.2.4) in `investigation/raw/`.

**How the claims were checked.** Two pieces of analysis code were written to test the rules against real map data:
- `replica.py` is a steady-state port of the soil-moisture system. It matches the saved `MoistureLevels` exactly (within 0.02) on 100 % of tiles on 9 official maps, at least 99.4 % on 9 more, and 97.2 % on Beaverome. Across about 180 000 moist tiles it disagrees on whether a tile is moist or dry for only 14 tiles.
- `simwater.py` / `simwater2.py` are a single-layer numpy port of the water simulator. Starting from an empty map, it reproduces the saved water of the 1.1 save `generated-river-valley-day1-2` to within 0.001 m in every cell after the same number of ticks (975). It also matches Diorama and Waterfalls exactly, and Meander at IoU 0.99.

The scripts are in the session scratchpad, not in the repo. The algorithms are described in full below.

## Key constants

| What | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tick | 0.6 s, with 2 water substeps per tick, so dt = 0.3 s | `TickTime.blueprint`, `WaterSimulationTaskStarter.SubstepCount=2` |
| Day | 768 ticks = 460.8 s | `DayNightCycleSpec.ConfiguredDayLengthInTicks`, `DayNightCycle.DayLengthInSeconds` |
| Terrain height | 23 voxel layers (`MaxGameTerrainHeight` 22 + 1) | `MapSizeSpec` |
| Total height | 33 = 23 + `MaxHeightAboveTerrain` 10 | `MapSizeSpec` |
| Open-column ceiling | 34 | `WaterSimulator._maxColumnHeight = TotalSize.z + 1` |
| Water units | 1 = one tile × one height level ("m³"). A water source strength S adds S m³ per second, which is S × 460.8 m³ per day. | |

## Q1. WaterSource and BadwaterSource

### Answer

| | WaterSource | BadwaterSource |
|---|---|---|
| Footprint | 1×1×1 ("Ground/All") | 3×3×1 (all cells "Floor, Bottom, Corners, Path, Middle") |
| Emits at | its single cell | all 9 cells, S/9 each |
| `DefaultStrength` | 1.0 | 3.0 |
| Contamination | 0 (becomes badwater during badtide) | 1.0 always |
| Max strength | 8 | 72 (8 per cell) |
| `TimeActivatedComponent` | yes | yes |
| Badtide controller | `BadtideWaterSourceContaminationControllerSpec` | none |

Both types sit on terrain: solid voxel at z−1, air at z. This held for all 170 WaterSources and 69 BadwaterSources in the official maps. 29 WaterSources also have solid directly above them, meaning they are placed in tunnels or caves. The BadwaterSource centre "cutout" is only a rendering hole (`TerrainService.SetCutout` is used only by rendering and selection code). No voxel changes.

**Where water enters.** `WaterSource.InitializeEntity` computes the emitting cells as `TransformTile(spec coords)` at z = `BlockObject.z + BaseZ`. Each substep, `UpdateWaterSourcesTask` adds `dt · CurrentStrength / N` to the water column that contains z (`MutableWaterColumnRetriever.GetColumn`). Some consequences:
- The source cell itself is not a water obstacle.
- A source under a lake keeps emitting.
- If the column is full, for example in a sealed cave, the extra water becomes Overflow (pressure).
- Rotation maps a block offset (dx, dy) to `Coordinates + rot(dx, dy)`, where Cw90 → (dy, −dx), Cw180 → (−dx, −dy) and Cw270 → (−dy, dx).

**What the strength numbers mean.**
- `SpecifiedStrength` is the designer value: volume per second of game time, spread over the source's cells. It is not a height per tick.
- `CurrentStrength` = `SpecifiedStrength` × the product of all `IWaterStrengthModifier`s (see below), clamped to `8 × cells`.
- `CurrentStrength` is saved, but it is recomputed on `PostInitializeEntity` and on every tick. The value written into a map therefore does not matter.
- Official maps store it as 0 for sources that are delayed or conditional (aquifers, drains, delayed sources).

Two things a generated map must get right:
- **Write `Singletons.WaterSimulationMigrator = {"IsMigrated": true}`.** Without it, `WaterSimulationMigrator` halves every source's `SpecifiedStrength` and all stored outflows on load (`ScaleRatio 0.5`). All 1.1 official maps have the flag. The 0.x workshop maps do not.
- **Map-edge sources do not leak.** `WaterMapBoundary` is decorated onto every `IWaterSource`. For each source cell, it turns the out-of-map padding cells that are 4-neighbours into solid cells (`FullyBlockCell`). This is what lets 63 official sources sit on the map border (the Meander river enters at y = 127).

**Modifiers applied to every WaterSource** (these are decorators in `WaterSourceSystemConfigurator` / `GameWaterSourceSystemConfigurator`):
- `DroughtWaterStrengthModifier` (all sources, clean and bad):
  - Returns 0 for the whole hazardous period of a drought cycle, and 1 during badtide.
  - Ramps down before a drought, starting T = S / (DayLengthInSeconds × 0.0058) = S / 2.673 days before it. For S = 1 that is 0.37 days, for S = 3 it is 1.1 days.
  - The ramp shape is `1 − (p/T)·(0.85·p/T + 0.15)`.
  - It ramps up the same way at the start of the next cycle.
  - (`WaterStrengthSpec`: MaxWaterSourceChangePerSecond 0.0058, MinWaterSourceChangeScaler 0.15.)
- `WaterSourceActivator` gives 0 until the `TimedComponentActivator` fires, if the activator is enabled.
- `BadtideWaterSourceContaminationController` only exists on sources whose blueprint has the spec: WaterSource, WaterSeep, BadwaterSeep, Aquifer and DevWaterSource.
  - During badtide it sets the emitted contamination to `0.5 + 0.5·sech(17(t − 0.5))`. That is 0.5 at the moment the badtide starts, 1.0 after half a day, back to 0.5 in the last half day, and 0 when it ends.
  - The source keeps full strength, so clean sources emit badwater during badtide.

**`TimeActivatedComponent`** (`ActivatorSystem.TimedComponentActivator`, saved under the key "TimeActivatedComponent"):
- Fields: `IsEnabled` (bool), `CyclesUntilCountdownActivation` (int, default 5), `DaysUntilActivation` (float, default 10), `DaysPassed` (float).
- The spec has `IsOptionallyActivable: true`, so `IsEnabled` defaults to false and the source is active from day 1.
- If `IsEnabled` is true, the source is off (strength 0) until Cycle ≥ N and `DaysPassed + dayProgress ≥ DaysUntilActivation`. `DaysPassed` increases by 1 at each day start once Cycle ≥ N, except on cycle N day 1, when the countdown event fires. In practice the source turns on around cycle N, day D+1.
- `IsHazardousActivator` only changes the UI.
- Official maps: 150 of 170 WaterSources have `IsEnabled: false`. 20 are delayed (N = 3–19, D = 10.5). Nomads uses 20 delayed sources.

**Strengths used in official maps**

| Type | Values (count) | Typical |
|---|---|---|
| WaterSource | 0.25 (11), 0.5 (105), 0.75 (6), 1.0 (43), 1.25 (3), 1.5 (2) | 0.5 |
| BadwaterSource | 0.5 (4), 0.75 (1), 1.0 (17), 1.5 (26), 2.0 (9), 3.0 (12) | 1.5 |

Total clean strength active at start, per map: 2.0–10.5 m³/s (ThousandIslands 27). Maps: Canyon 2.0 on 128², Meander 5.5 on 128², Plains 4.5 on 256², Lakes 7.0, Terraces 7.75. Sources are usually 1×1 WaterSources placed in rows of 3–8, for example Meander's 8 sources at y = 127.

### Evidence
`WaterSourceSystem`: `WaterSource`, `DroughtWaterStrengthModifier`, `BadtideWaterSourceContaminationController`, `WaterStrengthService`. `WaterSystem`: `UpdateWaterSourcesTask.Run`, `WaterMapBoundary`, `WaterSimulationMigrator`. `ActivatorSystem`: `TimedComponentActivator`. `GameWaterSourceSystem`: `WaterSourceActivator`. Blueprints `MapEditor/Water/*`, `Configurations/WaterStrength`. Entity survey of all official maps.

**Confidence:** high.

### Implications
- Emit per cell as S/N.
- In validation, set strength to 0 for delayed sources and for the whole drought, including the ramp.
- Put `WaterSimulationMigrator.IsMigrated = true` in world.json.
- Edge sources are safe, and rivers can enter from the border.
- Budget 2–10 m³/s of clean water per map, like the official maps.
- During badtide every clean source turns bad, so a generator cannot promise clean surface water during badtide except from stored reservoirs.

## Q2. Water simulation

### Answer: the algorithm (`Timberborn.WaterSystem`)

**Grid and columns**
- The index space is padded by 1 cell on every side: stride = X+2 and verticalStride = (X+2)(Y+2) (`MapIndexService.Margin = 1`).
- Each (x, y) holds a stack of water columns, which are the vertical air gaps: `Floor` = first air z and `Ceiling` = next solid z, or 34 if nothing is above.
- Stacks are built by starting from column (0, 34) and applying `AddFullObstacle` for every terrain voxel and for every entity water obstacle:
  - `Blockage`: a full block.
  - `NaturalOverhang*`: a support block plus horizontal obstacles one level up, which forms a roof.
  - `BadtideDrain`: a back wall plus a roof over the emitter.
  - `NaturalDam`: a *partial* obstacle 0.65 high (`WaterObstacle.AddToWaterService`).
- Horizontal obstacles split a column at z without filling a voxel.
- Ruins, Slope, relics and other buildings do not obstruct water, because they have no `WaterObstacleSpec`.
- Water never moves vertically between the stacked columns of one cell. It only moves horizontally, between columns of 4-neighbour cells whose z-ranges overlap.

**Column state.** `WaterColumn` holds Floor, Ceiling, WaterDepth, OldWaterDepth, Contamination and Overflow.
- `Overflow` is the water above the ceiling of a full column (pressurised caves).
- `OverflowPressureFactor` = 8: overflow counts ×8 in the head, and its share of a flow is divided by 8.
- Maximum overflow is `(34 − ceiling)/8`.

**Serialisation** (`WaterColumnPackedListSerializer`)
- 1.1 writes `depth:contamination:overflow:floor:oldDepth`, or `"0"` if depth, contamination and overflow are all 0.
- 1.0 and 0.7 write only the first 4 fields. `OldWaterDepth` then defaults to depth on load (`[BackwardCompatible(2026,4,29)]`).
- Arrays are packed as `slot·X·Y + y·X + x`, where slot is the k-th column from the bottom of that cell. It is not z.
- **On load only depth, oldDepth, contamination and overflow are copied, by slot.** Floor is recomputed from terrain and obstacles (`WaterSimulator.PostLoad`). A generator must therefore put water in the right slot. On a heightfield map with no entity obstacles, that is always slot 0.
- `Levels` = the maximum slot count at save time. Official maps use 2–4. A pure heightfield can use 1.
- The pre-Nov-2023 singleton `WaterMap` (`WaterDepths` and `Outflows` "B:L:T:R") is still loaded by `WaterMapLoader`.

**`ColumnOutflows`** hold the flow "momentum" per column.
- Format: `Bottom:Left:Top:Right[:extra…]`. Each entry is `"0"` or `index3D|flow`, where `index3D = slot·(X+2)(Y+2) + (y+1)(X+2) + (x+1)` in padded indexing.
- Extra entries exist when a column flows into several stacked columns of one neighbour.
- Bottom = −y, Left = −x, Top = +y, Right = +x.
- **Writing all `"0"` is safe.** Momentum rebuilds within a few ticks.

**One substep** (dt = 0.3 s, run twice per tick in parallel tasks in this order: `OutflowsUpdateTask` → `WaterParametersUpdateTask` → `SimulateContaminationTask` → `UpdateContaminationTask` → `UpdateWaterSourcesTask`; `UpdateWaterChangesTask` then runs once per tick for pumps and other buildings):

1. **Outflows** (`OutflowsUpdateTask.GetOutflow`).
   - For every column c with d + o > 0 and every 4-neighbour column n that overlaps it (`n.Ceiling > c.Floor` and `n.Floor < c.Floor + d_c`):
     - `H = floor + depth`, and `P = overflow·8`.
     - `Δ = (H_c + P_c) − (H_n + P_n)`. The pressure part of Δ is divided by 8 (see the code snippet below).
     - `f = 0.999·f_prev(c→n) + 2.25·dt·Δ_eff`, where `2.25·dt` = 0.675.
     - Spill threshold: if n is dry, has no height limit and has the same floor as c, `Δ_eff −= 0.1`.
     - Direction limiters (from `DirectionalWaterSource`) and inflow limits from buildings apply.
   - Only f > 0 is kept. Negative flows are dropped, so each side handles its own direction.
   - Normalise: if `Σf·dt > d_c + o_c`, scale all of c's outflows by `(d_c + o_c)/(Σf·dt)`. A column can empty in one substep, but never go below 0.
2. **Partial obstacles (dams and weirs, crest h_lim).** For a flow into a target whose floor has a height limit, with `hd = H_c + P_c − floor_n`:
   - If `hd < h_lim`, then `f = 0.995·f_prev − 0.02·clamp01(clamp01((h_lim−hd)/0.1) · clamp(1 − 2.25·(H_c − floor_c − oldDepth_c), 0.5, 2))`. The flow decays; no new flow is added.
   - If `hd − h_lim < 0.1`, the new-flow term is scaled by `(hd − h_lim)/0.1`.
   - Otherwise the flow is normal, with `f_prev ×0.995`.
3. **Depth update** (`WaterParametersUpdateTask.ProcessWaterDepthChanges`).
   - `net = Σ inflow − Σ outflow`.
   - `depth += (net − evap)·dt`, through `WaterDepthSetter`: depth is clamped at 0, and anything beyond the column height becomes Overflow.
   - The stored momentum for the next substep is `out(c→n) = max(0, f(c→n) − 0.8·f(n→c))` (`OutflowBalancingScaler` 0.8). This damps sloshing.
4. **Evaporation per second:**
   - Rate: `(depth < 0.02 ? 0.001 : 0.0001) × EvaporationModifier[column]`.
   - The modifier is recomputed every tick from the soil-moisture cluster saturation: 1 if sat = 0, otherwise `0.0595(10−sat)² + 0.101(10−sat) + 0.72`.
   - For sat 1…8 that gives 6.45, 5.34, 4.34, 3.47, 2.71, 2.08, 1.56 and 1.16.
   - Daily depth loss (×460.8 s): lakes at least 3 wide (sat 8) lose 0.0535 m/day, a 2-wide channel (sat 6) 0.096, a 1-wide channel (sat 3) 0.20 and an isolated cell 0.30. Films under 0.02 lose 10× that.
   - `WaterEvaporationMap.EvaporationModifiers` (Levels + one value per slot) is only a cache. Writing 1s is fine.
   - Evaporation does **not** depend on the weather. No weather reference exists in `WaterSystem` or `SoilMoistureSystem`.
5. **Contamination.**
   - Contamination is a concentration that moves with the flows as a volume-weighted mix (`SimulateContaminationTask`).
   - It also diffuses between adjacent columns when the net flow is below 0.125 and the surfaces differ by less than 0.1, at a rate of 0.45.
   - It is capped at 1.
   - Sources mix their own contamination into the cell they emit into.
6. **Sources:** `d += dt·S/N` on each source cell.

Key formula (`OutflowsUpdateTask.GetOutflow`):
```csharp
float num5 = num + num2 - (num3 + num4);          // head diff incl. overflow*8
if (num5 > 0f) { ... num10 = num5 - num9 + num9 / overflowPressureFactor; }
float num16 = _waterFlowRetriever.GetFlow(targetIndex3D, in outflows) * 0.999f;
...
else if (targetColumn.WaterDepth + targetColumn.Overflow == 0f && floor == floor2)
    num10 -= _waterSpillThreshold;                  // 0.1
return num16 + _waterFlowFactor * num10;          // _waterFlowFactor = 2.25*dt
```

**Maximum flow.**
- There is no explicit maximum. Flow is limited only by volume: total outflow ≤ (d+o)/dt = 3.33·d per second.
- There are also per-cell `InflowLimits` (buildings; the default is unlimited) and the source cap of 8 per cell.
- Friction is tiny: steady uniform flow F needs only Δh ≈ 0.001·F/0.675 ≈ 0.0015·F per cell. **Water surfaces are almost flat**, and rivers behave like chains of level pools joined by waterfalls.

**Map edges are sinks.**
- Padding cells are open columns (floor 0, ceiling 34) that are never updated: their depth is always 0 and they have no outflow.
- Water that reaches an edge cell flows into the void with head `H_c − 0`, so it drains, limited by volume.
- The saved outflows confirm this: every official map's off-map outflow roughly equals its active source strength (Cliffside 3.93 of 4.0, Canyon 3.77 of 4.0, Meander 6.22 of 6.5, Terraces 11.9 of 13.25). The generated save has 5 edge cells at x = 95 with flow ≈ depth/0.3.
- The exception is padding next to source cells, which is solid (Q1).
- Terrain that is higher at the border holds water in. The edge only drains cells whose water can reach them.

### How close can a simplified model get?
- **Pure heightfield maps** (no caves, overhang objects, dams or blockages): a single-layer port of the rules above (no overflow, no stacks) is essentially exact.
  - Generated save: max |Δd| = 0.001 after 975 ticks from empty.
  - Diorama and Waterfalls: IoU 1.00. Meander, with NaturalDam, Blockage and edge sources added: IoU 0.99, volume within 1.5 %.
- **Maps that route water through tunnels or caves** (Cliffside 24 wet cells under a roof, Canyon 180, Terraces 473): a single-layer model blocks the tunnels and floods basins that really drain (IoU 0.25–0.7). Either keep the generator's terrain free of water tunnels, or implement stacked columns.
- **Time to steady state:** about 600–1 000 ticks (0.8–1.3 days) on a 96² or 128² map, with an overshoot. For example, the river-valley volume was 278 at tick 300 and 230 at tick 600. Large 256² maps with big basins take 2 000–3 000 ticks.
- **Cheaper still:** steady-state lake levels equal their spill level (priority-flood fill-and-spill), because surfaces are flat. Add about 0.1 m minimum sheet depth on flat ground (the spill threshold) and river depth of at least 0.3·S/width. This is good for lake extents. It says nothing about transients or how fast basins drain after sources stop.
- **Official maps are snapshots.** They ship with pre-simulated water and are mostly at steady state (their off-map outflow ≈ source strength).

**Confidence:** high for the algorithm (read from code and validated against saves). Medium for the contamination-diffusion details (summarised, not replicated).

### Implications
- A browser WebWorker can run the exact single-layer rule set at about 65 k cells × 1 536 substeps per game day.
- Validate with one to two game days of "sources on", then a drought of D days with sources off (after the ramp).
- Write the steady-state water into `WaterMapNew` so the map starts alive, like the official maps.
- Keep river beds free of stacked overhangs, or implement stacks.

## Q3. Soil moisture (`Timberborn.SoilMoistureSystem`)

### Answer
There is one moisture value per terrain column top (index 3D by terrain-column slot).

**Moisture value on and next to water**
- Cluster saturation of a wet water column: `WN = 1 + number of wet 8-neighbours` whose vertical range overlaps; `sat = min(8, max(WN, max over 4-neighbours of (WN_n − 1)))`.
  - A lake or river at least 3 wide gives sat 8, a 2-wide channel 6, a straight 1-wide channel 3 and a single puddle 1.
- The water's "range" = `2·sat`, so the maximum is 16.
  - If contamination c ≥ 0.01, range = `int(range·(1 − c/0.53))`, which is 0 for c ≥ 0.53. **Badwater gives no moisture.**
- A tile with clean water on it (c ≤ 0.01) gets exactly `2·sat`. This value is fixed and is not raised by its neighbours.
- A tile next to water (4-neighbour) gets `range − 6·max(0, tileZ − ceil(waterFloor + depth))`.
  - A tile under a full water-filled column (a roof over water) gets `range − 6·(roofThickness − 1)`.

**Spread**
- From 8-neighbours of the last tick: `m_n − cost − 6·max(0, tileZ − neighbourZ − ceil(neighbourWaterDepth))`, with cost 1 orthogonal and 1.414 diagonal.
- Going down costs nothing extra. **Each level up costs 6** (`VerticalSpreadCostMultiplier`).
- The steady-state value is `max(direct, fromNeighbours)`, then multiplied by `(1 − contamination of the water on the tile)`. Values below 0.01 become 0.
- The tile counts as moist (`SoilIsMoist`) if the value is > 0.

**Reach**
- Horizontal reach from a big clean lake at bank level: a tile at chamfer distance d from the water has `17 − d`, so **16 tiles**. A 1-wide stream reaches 6 tiles and a puddle 2.
- Vertical reach: every bank level above the *ceiled* water surface costs 6.
  - 1 level up gives 10 tiles, 2 levels 4 tiles, and 3 levels nothing.
  - Because the surface is ceiled, 0.5 m of water on floor h counts as surface h+1. **A river bed 1 below the banks gives the full 16. A bed 2 below with water under 1 m deep gives only 10.**

**What blocks moisture** (`SoilBarrierMap`, at the object's ground cell):
- `BlockFullMoisture` forces the tile to 0: Thorns (map object) and IrrigationBarrier.
- `BlockAboveMoisture`: water standing on or above that tile does not moisten it: Levee, ImpermeableFloor, ImpermeablePowerShaft, CompactMechanicalPump.
- Height differences and contaminated water also block it.
- Barrier lines must be 4-connected, because diagonal spread can leak past a diagonal line.
- Map edges do not wrap.
- `DesertMoistureThreshold` 5 only drives the dry texture.

**Speed**
- A tile next to water rises by `6.66·0.6 = 4` per tick.
- The front moves 1 tile per tick, so the full 16-tile band exists within about 20 ticks (12 s).
- Decay is `1.25·0.6 = 0.75` per tick, so a band **disappears about 20 ticks after its water is gone**. The moist zone follows the water almost instantly.

### Evidence
- Code: `ClusterSaturationCalculationTask`, `WateredNeighborsCountingTask`, `MoistureCalculationTask.CalculateMoistureForCell` / `GetMoistureFromWater` / `GetMoistureFromNeighbor`, `SoilMoistureSimulationTaskStarter`, `SoilBarrier`. Blueprint `SoilMoistureSimulator` (decay 1.25, spread 6.66, vertical ×6, MaxClusterSaturation 8, MaximumWaterContamination 0.53).
- Replica check against saved `MoistureLevels`:
  - 100 % exact on the 1.1 river-valley save and on 9 official maps (Meander, Plains, Terraces, ThousandIslands and others), at least 99.4 % on 9 more, and 97.2 % on Beaverome.
  - Mean absolute error at most 0.021.
  - Moist/dry disagreements: 14 tiles in total across all maps.
- Maximum chamfer distance from moistening water (c < 0.53) to a moist tile, on every official map: **16.14–16.48**, 99th percentile 11–16.
- Save `generated-river-valley`:
  - All 291 bank cells are exactly 1 level above ceil(surface).
  - Moisture next to the water is 10, then falls by 1 per tile. Maximum reach is 10.48.
  - Values by distance: d = 1 → 10, 2 → 9, 3 → 8, 4 → 7, 5 → 6 … up to d ≈ 10.5.
- Official maps: 87 % of tiles at distance 1 from clean water are moist, 60 % at 5, 39 % at 10, 13 % at 16 and about 6 % at ≥ 17 (those near partially contaminated water).

**Confidence:** very high.

### Implications for the validator
- Compute moisture with the exact steady-state rule (Dijkstra/max-plus propagation is fine; see the spec).
- Keep river water surfaces within 1 level of the land that should be fertile. Beds 1 deep, or 2 deep with water above 1 m.
- Farm and forest land must lie within 16 tiles and at most about 2 levels above a sat-8 water body that **persists through drought**.

## Q4. What trees and bushes need

### Mechanisms (`Timberborn.NaturalResourcesMoisture`, `NaturalResourcesContamination`, `NaturalResourcesLifecycle`)
- **Dry.** `WateredNaturalResource` starts a timer of `DaysToDieDry × U(0.9, 1.1)` days when the tile's moisture is 0 (`DryObject` checks `SoilIsMoist(CoordinatesAtBaseZ)`). There is **no minimum moisture above 0**. If moisture returns, the timer **resets** fully instead of pausing.
- **Flood** (`FloodableNaturalResourceSpec`, `LivingWaterObject`).
  - `WaterAboveBase = ceil(floor + depth) − z`. Any water at all on the tile counts as 1.
  - Outside `[MinWaterHeight, MaxWaterHeight]`, a `DaysToDie` timer runs.
  - All land species use 0..0, so any water on the tile floods them.
- **Arid** (Succulent): `AridNaturalResourceSpec.DaysToDieWet` = 8. The succulent dies if its tile is **moist**. Planting also requires the tile to be dry (`PlantingSoilValidator`).
- **Contamination:** soil contamination > 0 on the tile kills any plant in 0.2–0.3 days (`ContaminatedNaturalResource`). Planting and spawning are blocked there.
- **While dying, growth pauses**, and so do gatherable regrowth and reproduction.
- **When dead:**
  - Trees keep their **cuttable logs**. Only Succulent loses its yield (`DeadCuttableYieldRemover`).
  - Gatherable yield (berries, resin, syrup, chestnuts) is removed.
  - Dead plants never grow or reproduce, and foresters may replace them (`TreeComponent.CanBeReplaced`).
  - The saved form is `LivingNaturalResource: {"IsDead": true}`.
- **Map editor:** `InstantNaturalResource` kills a plant *instantly* when it is dry, flooded or contaminated (wet for arid species), and revives it when conditions return.
  - This is why every official map stores dry-soil trees as dead: 13 944 dead pines on dry soil against 6 291 living pines, all on moist soil. All 2 805 succulents sit on dry soil.
- **In game** a living tree placed on dry soil dies after about DaysToDieDry. In the save after 1.27 days, dry Oak/Birch/Pine had DyingProgress 0.086/0.118/0.100, which is 1.27/15, 1.27/11 and 1.27/13.
- **Reproduction** (`NaturalResourceReproducer`):
  - Every living, grown, non-dying plant marks its 4 neighbours at the same z.
  - For each species, the chance per tick is `ReproductionChance × count × dtDays`, spawning one plant per tick at a random marked spot. For example, 0.03 means about 3 % per spot per day.
  - A spawn must pass these checks (`SpawnValidationService`): on ground, **moist**, not a field, not underwater (floodable species need their water range), not contaminated, and unobstructed.
- **Map-placed plants do spread** (they are ordinary `Reproducible`s). Succulent has no `ReproducibleSpec`.

### Per species (blueprints `NaturalResources/*`)

| Species | Faction | DaysToDieDry | Flood Min..Max / DaysToDie | Other | Grow (days) | Reproduce/day | Yield |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pine | common | 13 | 0..0 / 12 | | 12 | 0.03 | 2 logs; resin 2 / 7 d |

Every species also has `ContaminatedNaturalResourceSpec`, which kills it in 0.2–0.3 days on contaminated soil. Faction membership comes from `TemplateCollection.NaturalResources.*`. Species outside the chosen faction's collection probably cannot load (see the in-game check list).

**Confidence:** high.

### Implications
- Place living plants only on tiles where steady-state moisture is > 0, no water is on the tile, and soil contamination is 0.
- Succulents need moisture = 0. Mangroves need 0 < depth ≤ 1 on the tile.
- For "dead forest" log caches, write `LivingNaturalResource.IsDead = true`, as the official maps do. The logs stay harvestable.
- For forests to **survive a drought**, their moisture must come from water that persists, or the drought must be shorter than 0.9 × DaysToDieDry.
  - Normal droughts (up to 9 days) threaten Chestnut, Dandelion, Coffee (8) and Mangrove (6), and Blueberry (9) is borderline.
  - Hard droughts (15–30 days) kill everything that loses its water.

## Q5. Soil contamination (`Timberborn.SoilContaminationSystem`)

### Answer
- Only water with contamination **≥ 0.5** contaminates soil (`MinimumWaterContamination` 0.5).
- A tile next to such water gets the candidate value `2·(c − 0.5) − (5/7)·levelsAboveCeiledSurface`. A tile under a full water column gets the same, with `(5/7)·(roofThickness − 1)`.
- Spread: neighbour value − 1/7 orthogonal (√2/7 diagonal), − 5/7 per level up (`MaxRangeFromSource` 7, `VerticalSpreadCostMultiplier` 5).
- **Reach from pure badwater is 7 tiles.** Measured maximum chamfer distance on all official maps: 7.83. Soil is 60 % contaminated at d = 1, 20 % at 7 and 0 % at ≥ 8.
- Candidate values rise by up to 0.0396 and decay by 0.0198 per tick. The actual level moves toward the candidate at +0.021 or −0.006 per tick. Below 0.001 it becomes 0.
- The soil counts as contaminated if the level is > 0. It turns on within a few ticks and takes about 170 ticks (0.2 days) per 1.0 of level to clear.
- **Effects:**
  - Plants die in 0.2–0.3 days, and planting and spawning are refused.
  - Badwater also gives no moisture, and it scales the moisture of a tile it covers by (1 − c).
  - **Beavers are not affected by soil.** Only standing in water with c ≥ 0.05 matters: per tick the chance is c·0.01 (`ContaminationApplier`), followed by a 3-day incubation, then the `BadwaterContamination` need, which an antidote cures.
- **Counter-measures:**
  - Contamination barriers: Thorns (map object) and IrrigationBarrier (IronTeeth) block both contamination and moisture. ContaminationBarrier (Folktails) blocks contamination only.
  - Keep badwater out: levees and dams.
  - Buildings on a BadwaterSource: BadwaterDome (Folktails, open/close regulator), BadwaterRig (disables the source entirely), BadwaterPressurizer (IronTeeth, regulator that also ignores drought).
  - Pillars has 1 473 Thorns, and its contaminated soil never lies more than 2 tiles from badwater. This is probably because of the Thorns, though most of that map is covered by badwater.

### Evidence
`ContaminationCandidatesCountingTask`, `ContaminationsUpdateTask`, `SoilContaminationSimulationTaskStarter`, blueprints `SoilContaminationSimulator` and `SoilContaminationMap`, `BeaverContaminationSystem.ContaminationApplier` and `ContaminationIncubator`. Data check on the official maps as above.

**Confidence:** high.

### Implications
- Keep fertile, forest and start areas at least 8 tiles from any badwater, including where badwater will spread (downstream of BadwaterSources) and seasonal badtide flows.
- Thorns lines (4-connected) are the map-level fix.

## Q6. 1.0+ water entities

| Entity | Footprint / emitter | world.json components | Official values | Behaviour and placement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WaterSeep** | 2×2×1, emits over all 4 cells (S/4 each). The 4 cutouts are only visual. | `WaterSource`, `BlockObject`, `WaterDepthStrengthModifier{CurrentModifier}`, `TimeActivatedComponent` | S = 1.0 (17), 2.0 (3). Craters 2, Helix 3, Lakes 1, Oasis 1, Pillars 4, Pressure 1, Spillage 8 | `WaterDepthStrengthModifier` (`DepthLimit` 0.8) turns it off when water depth at its anchor cell is > 0.8 and back on below 0.72, fading in at 0.5 per second of `Time.deltaTime`. **It cannot fill anything deeper than about 0.8 m over its floor.** It stops in drought and emits badwater in badtide. Place on flat ground (all 4 cells at the same z). |
| **BadwaterSeep** | same as WaterSeep | same | S = 1.0 (6). Nomads 1 (delayed to cycle 13), Spillage 5 | Same as WaterSeep, with contamination 1 and `IsHazardousActivator` true. |
| **Aquifer** | 3×3×1, emits only at the centre (1,1) at surface z | `BlockObject`, `WaterSource` (no activator) | S = 1.0 (11). Oasis 10, Pillars 1 | `UndergroundWaterSource` sets strength 0 unless a *finished drill* occupies it. That can be the map-placed **AncientAquiferDrill** or the player's **AquiferDrill** (400 science; 40 planks, 25 gears, 15 metal blocks). Output = S × the drill's `PowerEfficiency`. The ancient drill needs **200 hp**, the player drill **400 hp**, and both are **unpowered at map start**, so the player must connect power. The drill is **blocked during any hazardous weather** (`UndergroundWaterSourceDrill.Block` then `MechanicalNode.Active` false). It gives 0 in badtide, and the aquifer's own drought modifier gives 0 in drought. **Code says aquifers only produce in temperate weather** (needs in-game check). Also emits badwater in badtide, but the drill is off then anyway. |
| **AncientAquiferDrill** | 3×3×5 building | `BlockObject` only | Oasis 2 | `UnderstructureConstraint` requires an Aquifer with exactly the same 3×3 footprint (any orientation; see the Oasis pairs). `PlaceFinished: true`. Mechanical input transputs at block (1,0,0) and (1,0,1). |
| **BadtideDrain** | 1×3×1. (0,0) is a full water obstacle (back wall). (0,1) is the emitter, with a roof (horizontal obstacle at z+1). (0,2) is the open outlet. | `WaterSource`, `BlockObject{Orientation}`, `TimeActivatedComponent` | S = 1.0 (59), 0.5 (2). Canyon 3, Craters 2, Meander 3, Oasis 18, Pillars 15, Spillage 18, Waterfalls 2 | `HazardousWeatherWaterSource` makes it active only while the current hazardous weather is badtide. Contamination is 1. `DirectionalWaterSource` limits the emitter cell to the orientation axis (Cw0 → +y, Cw90 → +x, Cw180 → −y, Cw270 → −x), so water only exits forward. **Official placement (all 61):** cells (0,0) and (0,1) sit in a 1-high notch in a cliff (solid at z−1 and z+1), and (0,2) is open air with **no ground below**, a spout over a drop. |
| **GeothermalField** | 3×3×1; the centre cutout is visual only | `BlockObject` only | 26 placed (Beaverome 3, Canyon 1, MountainRange 2, Oasis 4, Pillars 6, Spillage 7, ThousandIslands 3) | No water effect. `FloodableObject` with its water check at the centre: if flooded, it and the GeothermalEngine on it (both factions, 400 hp output, 160 science) are blocked. Place on flat, dry ground outside flood and badtide paths. |

All of these, except GeothermalField and the drill, are `WaterSource`s, so they share the Q1 rules: `DroughtWaterStrengthModifier`, `WaterMapBoundary`, the strength cap of 8 per cell, and the migration halving.

**Evidence:** blueprints `MapEditor/Water/*` and `MapEditor/Objects/GeothermalField`, `Buildings/Water/AquiferDrill`, `Buildings/Power/GeothermalEngine`. Code: `GameWaterSourceSystem` (`UndergroundWaterSource`, `UndergroundWaterSourceDrill`, `HazardousWeatherWaterSource`), `WaterSourceSystem` (`WaterDepthStrengthModifier`, `DirectionalWaterSource`), `WaterObjects` (`WaterObstacle`, `HorizontalWaterObstacle`, `FloodableObject`), `MechanicalSystem.MechanicalNode.Active`. Placement survey of all official maps, with rotation applied.

**Confidence:** high, except the aquifer's drought behaviour (medium: the code is clear but it contradicts intuition).

## Q7. Weather and reservoir calibration

### Durations (`NewGameModes/GameMode.*`, `HazardousWeatherSystem`, `WeatherSystem`)

| Mode | Temperate (days) | Drought (days) | Drought handicap | Badtide | Badtide duration | Badtide handicap | Water consumption |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | 16–19 | 2–4 | ×0.25, full after 8 droughts | from cycle 6, 40 % | 1–3 | ×0.3, 6 | ×0.4 |
| Normal | 13–17 | 5–9 | ×0.38, full after 5 | from cycle 5, 40 % | 4–8 | ×0.15, 5 | ×1.0 |
| Hard | 5–8 | 15–30 | ×0.2, full after 12 | from cycle 4, 40 % | 15–30 | ×0.4, 9 | ×1.0 |

- Each cycle is temperate then hazardous. `HazardousWeatherStartCycleDay = temperate + 1`.
- Duration = `round(U(min, max) × lerp(handicap, 1, (n−1)/handicapCycles))`, where n is the index of that weather type. The first Normal drought is therefore 2–3 days.
- The badtide chance is adjusted for streaks (`HazardousWeatherRandomizer`).

**Sources in hazardous weather**
- Drought: every WaterSource-based entity gives 0 for the whole drought, after a pre-drought ramp of S/2.67 days, and ramps back up over the same time at the next cycle. That covers WaterSource, BadwaterSource, both seeps and aquifers. The only exception is a BadwaterSource under an IronTeeth BadwaterPressurizer.
- Badtide: sources keep flowing, but clean ones emit badwater. BadtideDrains switch on. Aquifer drills stop.
- **Evaporation is the same in every weather.** Drought only removes inflow.

### Water use

**Per beaver.** Thirst `DailyDelta` is −0.7 and 1 Water gives 0.33, so a beaver drinks 2.12 Water per day. 1 Water good = **0.2 m³** of map water (`WaterGoodToWaterAmountConverter`). That is **0.424 m³ per beaver per day** on Normal and Hard, and 0.170 on Easy. Bots do not drink. Industry uses more: Coffee, Biofuel, Algae and the Discharge building's FlowingWater. Clean pumps scale their output by (1 − contamination) at the intake.

**Reservoir surface loss** is `e·A` per day: e = 0.0535 m/day for bodies at least 3 wide, and 0.1–0.3 for thin channels.

**Required volume**

  `V ≥ P·0.424·(D + ~0.5) + A·e·(D + ~0.5)`

With usable depth h and area A = V/h:

  `A ≥ P·0.424·(D+0.5) / (h − e·(D+0.5))`

| Mode | Drought used | Drink per beaver | Evaporation depth | Area per beaver at h = 2 | h = 3 | h = 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | 4 | 0.77 m³ | 0.24 m | 0.44 | 0.28 | 0.20 |
| Normal, typical | 7 | 3.2 m³ | 0.40 m | 2.0 | 1.2 | 0.88 |
| Normal, worst | 9 | 4.0 m³ | 0.51 m | 2.7 | 1.6 | 1.1 |
| Hard, typical | 22.5 | 9.8 m³ | 1.23 m | 12.7 | 5.5 | 3.5 |
| Hard, worst | 30 | 12.9 m³ | 1.63 m | 35 | 9.4 | 5.4 |

Example: 50 beavers on Normal (worst case) with a 2 m-deep usable reservoir need about 135 cells, about 270 m³: about 200 m³ is drunk and about 70 m³ evaporates.

**Hard needs reservoirs at least 3 m deep.** Otherwise evaporation over a 30-day drought (1.6 m) eats most of the water.

Usable depth is also capped by pump reach, from the `WaterInputPipeSpec.MaxDepth` values:

| Pump | MaxDepth |
|---|---|
| WaterPump | 2 |
| LargeWaterPump | 4 |
| DeepWaterPump (IronTeeth) | 6 |

Treat badtide (Normal 4–8, Hard 15–30) as a second "no clean inflow" period for any reservoir the player can seal off.

For scale: one S = 1 source delivers 460 m³/day. Refilling a 300 m³ reservoir therefore takes well under a day of temperate flow, if the reservoir is on the flow path.

**Confidence:** high for the numbers taken from code and blueprints. Medium for the per-beaver behaviour (needs are refilled from 2.12 drinks per day on average, and idle drinking patterns may vary).

## Simplified water simulation spec (browser implementation)

This spec is for heightfield terrain (one water column per cell). It is exact for maps without caves or overhang objects, as validated against the 1.1 save.

```
Grid X×Y. Per cell: floor F (int, the z of the first air voxel), depth D ≥ 0, contamination C ∈ [0,1],
stored outflow Out[k] for k ∈ {0:−y, 1:−x, 2:+y, 3:+x}. Optional per cell: hlim (dam crest; -1 = none;
NaturalDam = 0.65 at its cell), full obstacles are simply F += 1 (Blockage).
Out-of-map neighbour: F = 0, D = 0 always (a sink) — EXCEPT the 4 out-of-map neighbours of every
source cell, which are walls (no flow).
Constants: dt = 0.3 s; K = 2.25*dt = 0.675; SPILL = 0.1; KEEP = 0.999; BAL = 0.8;
EVAP = 1e-4/s (1e-3/s if D < 0.02); 1 tick = 2 substeps = 0.6 s; 1 day = 768 ticks.

Each tick:
  sat/evapMod from current wet mask:
    WN = wet ? 1 + (#wet 8-neighbours) : 0
    sat = wet ? min(8, max(WN, max_4nbr(WN_n − 1))) : 0
    evapMod = sat == 0 ? 1 : 0.0595*(10−sat)^2 + 0.101*(10−sat) + 0.72
  repeat 2 substeps:
    H = F + D                                             (all reads use start-of-substep state)
    for each cell c with D>0, each dir k, neighbour n:
       if n is a wall, or F_n >= H_c: f=0; continue       (never flow onto floor at/above own surface)
       prev = KEEP*Out_c[k]
       e = H_c − H_n
       if hlim_n >= 0 and F_n < ceil(H_c):                 (dam in target cell)
           hd = H_c − F_n
           if hd < hlim_n: f = 0.995*prev − 0.02*clamp01(clamp01((hlim_n−hd)/0.1)
                                        * clamp(1 − 2.25*(H_c − (F_c+Dold_c)), 0.5, 2))
           else: if hd−hlim_n < 0.1 and e > 0: e *= (hd−hlim_n)/0.1
                 f = 0.995*prev + K*e
       else:
           if D_n == 0 and F_n == F_c: e −= SPILL
           f = prev + K*e
       f_k = max(f, 0)
    s = Σ_k f_k ; if s*dt > D_c: f_k *= D_c/(s*dt)
    for each cell c:
       in_k = f(n_k → c)
       net = Σ in_k − Σ f_k
       Out_c[k] = max(0, f_k − BAL*in_k)
       Dold_c = D_c
       D_c = max(0, D_c + (net − EVAP(D_c)*evapMod_c)*dt)
       C_c = mass-weighted mix of (C_c*(D_c−outflowed) + Σ in_k*dt*C_n) / D_new   (clamp 0..1)
    for each source (cells P_i, strength S, contamination Cs):
       for each cell: D += dt*S/N ; C mixed with Cs
Sources: S = 0 while delayed (TimedComponentActivator), during drought (with the pre-drought ramp
  m(p)=1−(p/T)(0.85p/T+0.15), T=S/2.673 days), Aquifer unless drilled+powered and temperate,
  BadtideDrain except during badtide (then C=1 and outflow only along its orientation),
  Seep: off while D at its anchor > 0.8, back on < 0.72. Clean sources emit C≈1 during badtide.
Steady state: ~1 day of ticks for 128² maps (expect a transient overshoot); lakes end flat at spill level.
Validated: 1.1 save generated-river-valley (975 ticks from empty) max |ΔD| = 0.001; Diorama/Waterfalls
exact; Meander IoU 0.99 (with dams/blockage/edge-source walls). NOT valid where water passes under
roofs (caves, tunnels, NaturalOverhang, BadtideDrain interiors): implement stacked columns there
(columns = air gaps; flow between neighbour columns whose [floor, ceiling) overlap and whose floor
< origin surface; full columns store Overflow with head ×8 and flow share ÷8).

Soil moisture (exact steady state; validated ≥ 99.4 % tile-exact on 18/19 official maps, 97.2 % on Beaverome):

             cost 1 (orthogonal) / 1.414 (diagonal); multiply by (1 − C of water on t); <0.01 → 0
  moist ⇔ M > 0.
Soil contamination (same pattern): source 2*(C−0.5) (C≥0.5) − (5/7)*levels up; spread −1/7 (diag √2/7),
  −5/7 per level up; contaminated ⇔ > 0 (effectively reach 7 tiles).

world.json writing: WaterSimulationMigrator {IsMigrated:true}; WaterMapNew {Levels:1 for heightfields,
  WaterColumns "depth:cont:0:floor:depth" or "0", ColumnOutflows all "0"}; WaterEvaporationMap all 1;
  SoilMoistureSimulator/SoilContaminationSimulator may be zeros (recomputed in ~20 ticks) but writing the
  steady state avoids a first-tick "dry" flag on trees.
```

## Needs in-game check

1. **Aquifer in drought.** The code says aquifer drills are blocked in every hazardous weather, and the aquifer's own drought modifier gives 0. Check that an ancient drill with power gives no water during drought and badtide.
2. **Units.** Check that S = 1.0 fills about 460 m³ per game day. Time the filling of a closed basin of known volume.
3. **Evaporation.** Check that a sealed lake at least 3 wide loses about 0.054 m/day in any weather, and a 1-wide channel about 0.2 m/day.
4. **Dry trees at game start.** Check that a map with living trees on dry tiles loads with dying timers and not instant death. The save suggests timers. The map editor kills them instantly.
5. **Zero moisture at load.** Check that trees survive a map whose `MoistureLevels` are all 0 but whose water is pre-filled. `DryObject` starts dry, then resets the next tick. Also check this when water arrives only after hours.
6. **Badtide contamination curve.** Check that it jumps to 0.5 at the start, reaches 1 after half a day, and that clean pumps drop to (1−c).
7. **Seeps.** Check the 0.8 m cap, the 0.72 m restart, and whether the fade is in real time or game time (it uses `Time.deltaTime`).
8. **Edge sources.** Check that a source on the map border does not lose water straight off-map (`WaterMapBoundary`).
9. **BadtideDrain.** Check that water leaves only through the front cell, and how a drain behaves when its front cell has ground below.
10. **Pump reach.** Check the pump reach (MaxDepth 2/4/6) against the "usable depth" used in the reservoir sizing.
11. **Reproduction.** Check the rate on a map-placed forest edge: about ReproductionChance per open neighbour spot per day, only onto moist tiles.
12. **Faction species.** Check whether Folktails maps can contain IronTeeth-only species (Mangrove, CoffeeBush) and the reverse. The template collections suggest they may fail to load or get dropped.
13. **Tunnels.** Check how pressurised stacked columns in tunnels behave (Overflow, ×8 head), if DGM ever routes water under roofs.
