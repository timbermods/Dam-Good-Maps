# Map look captures

Before and after captures of the same maps from the same camera poses, for the Map look review
(ROADMAP "Map look", PLAN §20 D86, D110 and D114). The before captures show the 3D view at
`m8-done` (cfa5990); the after captures show it with Map look, after the reviews' fix rounds. Each
after capture also comes in greyscale and in three colour-blindness simulations (protanopia,
deuteranopia, tritanopia; Machado, Oliveira and Fernandes 2009, full severity, in linear RGB).

Made with `npx tsx tools/capture-look.ts --label before|after` (before on 2026-09-25, after on 2026-09-25), in the installed Chrome, headed, at 1280×800 CSS pixels and a device pixel ratio of 1. Each map is opened in the editor (generated maps with **Refine this map**, Beavertopia through the file input) with **Show dam sites** on, and only the 3D canvas is captured, except for one whole view per run. The after run takes every pose's camera from the before run's record. The **meets** and **cliff** poses came in the third round; their before captures were made the same way, with `--poses meets,cliff`, on `m8-done`'s code. The water is held at one moment of its movement.

The maps: seed 4242 in every theme at 128² (Normal), seed 4242 River Valley at 256², and
Beavertopia (a workshop map, 256²). Beavertopia's captures are not ours to share: they stay in
`.scratch/map-look/` on the machine that made them and are never committed.

## Where to look

For each capture, up to three example tiles of each meaning that are in view: the tile (x east,
y north, from the map's south-west corner) and its position in the after image, in pixels from
the top-left corner. The positions hold for the greyscale and colour-blind versions too, and for
the before image, which shares the camera (but for the objects that the after view draws
larger from afar).

The examples come from what the view draws: its heights, the water on each tile's top, the soil
of each tile's top (a tile over a cave shows its top's soil, not the cave floor's) and its
objects. Each position is the visible point: the water's surface, the middle of a tree or a
ruin, the middle of a wall, and the start, the slope arrows and the dead trees as they are drawn
from that distance. Ground and water examples lie inside an area of their kind (their eight
neighbours alike; in a view of the whole map, the 24 round them) and away from objects. No
example has an object on the tiles in front of it (toward the camera), sits under a dam site's
marker or under the start as it is drawn, or lies more than twice the pose's distance from the
camera (in the far haze); and every example was checked by picking the tile under its position
in the view.

- **Water partly bad** is water with some badwater in it (the percentage is given).
- **Badwater meets clean water** is the middle of the way from a badwater tile to the nearest
  clean water, at most four tiles off; the note names both ends. Our generated maps keep their
  badwater in its basins but for River Valley at 256², where it flows into the river; the
  **meets** pose looks at that, and at Beavertopia's.
- **Contaminated beside moist ground** is contaminated ground with moist ground next to it, at the
  same height.
- **Tall cliff** is a dry wall three levels high or more (no water on either side), facing the
  camera, whose middle the view shows first, where each level takes at least 6 pixels; the note
  gives the levels and about how many pixels a level takes. In a view of the whole map a level
  takes 1 to 4 pixels: there the levels show as the steps between terraces, and a tall cliff as a
  wide dark band, but they can't be counted. Every map's **cliff** pose looks at its tallest dry
  cliff from in front, to count them.
- **Slope** gives the way the slope rises; its arrow points that way.
- **Dam site** tiles are the editor's dam sites, shown with **Show dam sites**.
